This intelligent system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect falls and monitor the well-being of individuals, particularly seniors and vulnerable populations.

## Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring:** The system can analyze both live video streams and recorded footage.
- **Human pose estimation:** Utilizes deep learning models for accurate human pose estimation.
- **Fall detection:** Analyzes human kinematics to detect falls and assess fall risk.
- **Alert system:** Integrated alert system for immediate response to fall incidents and emergencies.
- **User-friendly interface:** Provides visual and quantitative feedback for caregivers and healthcare professionals.
- **Customizable:** Highly configurable and adaptable for various environments and use cases.
